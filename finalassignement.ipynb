    "Q3: INTRODUCTION :\n",
    "Data science is a multidisciplinary field that involves the use of statistical, mathematical, and programming techniques to extract insights and knowledge from large, complex data sets. It combines elements of computer science, mathematics, statistics, and domain-specific knowledge to analyze data and make data-driven decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science involves several steps in the data analysis process, including data collection, data cleaning and preparation, data exploration and visualization, statistical analysis, machine learning, and data interpretation and communication. Data scientists use a variety of tools and techniques to perform these tasks, including programming languages like Python and R, statistical software like SAS and SPSS, and data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The applications of data science are broad and diverse, ranging from business and finance to healthcare and social sciences. Companies use data science to make decisions about marketing, product development, and customer retention. Healthcare organizations use data science to analyze patient data and improve healthcare outcomes. Governments use data science to analyze social and economic data and make policy decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, data science is an increasingly important field in today's data-driven world, and its applications are likely to expand in the future as the amount of data continues to grow and new techniques are developed.\n",
